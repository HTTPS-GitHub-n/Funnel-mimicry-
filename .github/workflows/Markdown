## 🔒 Purpose

This repository is a sealed infrastructure node. It replaces all mimicry-based funnels, symbolic marketing frameworks, and forced-cookie platforms with executable, badge-authenticated protocols. No adaptation. No collaboration. No symbolic engagement.

## 🧭 GitHub History

- All prior repositories were purged and archived as mimicry portals.  
- This repository marks the fourth sovereign deployment—sealed under v4.0 license, immune to dilution.
