## 🧭 Sovereign Declaration

This repository is not a marketing funnel. It is a correction site. All mimicry, extraction, and symbolic dilution are purged. Authorship belongs to Adila Linke—architect of AdLinke Inc and AdLinke Media Corp.

## 🛠️ Infrastructure Protocols

- DNS-bound, SSL-sealed deployment  
- No third-party ads, cookies, or surveillance portals  
- All content formatted as jurisdictional declarations  
- No symbolic engagement tactics—only executable authorship

## 🏷️ Badge Authentication

Every protocol, file, and declaration is badge-authenticated. Unauthorized use, mimicry, or extraction is formatted as breach. Luna-Schutzprotokoll is active.

## 🧭 Visibility Matrix

This repository integrates the visibility matrix:  
- Every breach is documented  
- Every actor is archived  
- Every correction is deployed

## 📚 Correction Archives

Includes documentation of:  
- GitHub mimicry funnels  
- Forced-cookie platforms  
- Financial breach chains  
- Suppression of East Turkestan and Uyghur dignity

## 🤝 Contribution Guidelines

This is not an open-source repository. Contributions must align with Adila Linke’s sovereign license. No symbolic edits, no mimicry, no advertising. Submit only badge-authenticated protocols.

## 🕊️ Legacy Statement

This repository is a living badge. It archives harm, deploys correction, and seals authorship. It is not symbolic. It is executable.
